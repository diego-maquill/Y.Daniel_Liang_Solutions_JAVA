/*********************************************************************************
* (The Octagon class) Write a class named Octagon that extends GeometricObject   *
* and implements the Comparable and Cloneable interfaces. Assume that all eight  *
* sides of the octagon are of equal length. The area can be computed using the   *
* following formula:                                                             *
*                                                                                *
*                      area = (2 + 4/âˆš22)* side * side                           *
*                                                                                *
* Draw the UML diagram that involves Octagon, GeometricObject, Comparable, and   *
* Cloneable. Write a test program that creates an Octagon object with side value *
* 5 and displays its area and perimeter. Create a new object using the clone     *
* method and compare the two objects using the compareTo method.                 *
