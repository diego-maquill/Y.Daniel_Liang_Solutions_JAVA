/*********************************************************************************
* (Subclasses of Account) In Programming Exercise 9.7, the Account class was     *
* defined to model a bank account. An account has the properties account number, *
* balance, annual interest rate, and date created, and methods to deposit and    *
* withdraw funds. Create two subclasses for checking and saving accounts. A      *
* checking account has an overdraft limit, but a savings account cannot be       *
* overdrawn.                                                                     *
*                                                                                *
* Draw the UML diagram for the classes and then implement them. Write            *
* a test program that creates objects of Account, SavingsAccount, and            *
* CheckingAccount and invokes their toString() methods.                          *
